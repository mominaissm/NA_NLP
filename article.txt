Media freedom in China is declining at "breakneck speed", according to a report by a group representing foreign journalists in the country.

The report by the Foreign Correspondents Club (FCC) of China said journalists there face physical assaults, hacking, online trolling and visa denials.

Local journalists in mainland China and Hong Kong are also being targeted.

China has labelled the FCC an "illegal organisation".

It comes as the world's media turn their attention to the Beijing Winter Olympics, which is already under scrutiny due to alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and a crackdown in Hong Kong.

The report found that foreign journalists are being harassed so severely by the state that a handful of correspondents have left mainland China. Others have been forced to come up with emergency exit plans as a precaution.
For reporters attempting to cover Xinjiang - the controversial region that is home to many of China's Uyghurs - 88% of respondents said they had been followed. China's government has been accused of committing genocide against the Uyghurs, something it denies.

One reporter said they were accosted by men in plainclothes who physically assaulted them. "The videographer and I both got hit in the face, my lip was bleeding and they confiscated some of our equipment," they added.

In 2021, the BBC's China correspondent John Sudworth, who heavily reported on Xinjiang, left the country for Taiwan. He and his family were followed to the airport and into the check-in area by plainclothes police officers.

China has hit back at previous claims by the FCC that journalists were being harassed, claiming that the group has no sense of right and wrong and lacks principles.

"Foreign journalists in China should feel lucky," Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last year.
